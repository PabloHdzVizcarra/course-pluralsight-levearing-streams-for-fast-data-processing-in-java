## Module One: Introduction Parallelism in the Java Stream API

- Stream API introduced in 2014 in Java 8.
- Is based on lambda expressions and aggregation functions.
- Apply the parallelism.
- You can run a Stream in Java in **parallel** or **sequentially**
- If you execute a for loop and do not use its result, the JVM will not execute
  the for loop of the code.

**JMH Library**
